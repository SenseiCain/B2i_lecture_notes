CC - Lecture 3/3/21

Topics:
	- Update & Delete (last CRUD functions)
	- Validations (we’ll write our own)
	- Data modeling


Notes: 

CRUD - Create Read Update Delete

These RESTful routes are an industry standard way of mapping your controller’s to your models. They’re a LOT of info, but very reusable!

Models - remember you don’t want to interact with your data directly. We use models to MODEL the data, and use them as a middle ground between your Routes & Database.

Array.push() => Adds to an array
Array.splice(index, 1) => Removes from an array

Find, findIndex, map => these are what’s called “higher-order” functions, which simply means they are functions that are comprised of smaller functions.

In Postman if we wanted to reach the destroy route, we sent a DELETE requests.

For Show, Update, and Delete we need an index because we’re referencing an individual user.

REMEMBER - id doesn’t always correspond to index. An array is always going to start at 0. An id can be anything!

HW:

Watch the videos listed above & I’ll send some basic coding challenges.
Try to do everything we did tonight, without using the data modeling I.e. userClass. 
We can flip the script & have y’all code next week, that way we get more practice.
