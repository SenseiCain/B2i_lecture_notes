Lecture 7: Javascript and Github

Today we:

Part 1: Javascript:

		Worked with javascript arrays

definition: a list
getters:
learned how to index into an array riders[2]
setters
learned how to change an element riders[2] = 'jim'

https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrays.asp
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array

		Worked with objects

definition: a set of key value pairs
getters:
learned how to index into an object car.make or car['make']
setters
learned how to change a value car.make = 'honda'

https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_objects.asp
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Working_with_Objects

		Worked with loops
learned how to loop through an array
for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
}

https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_loop_for.asp
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Loops_and_iteration

		Worked with if statements

definitions: if a code statement evaluates to truthy, run a block of code
if (true) doSomething()

https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_if_else.asp
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/if...else

		Worked with functions

definition: declare a function that will run a block of code once it's evaluated

learned how functions are declared
function doSomething() {} vs const doSomething = () => {}

learned how to execute a function
doSomething()
how to return a value from a function
function doSomething() {
     return true
}

https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_functions.asp
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Functions

		Used functions to solve a specific task
Built a function that collected all of the odd numbers in an array
Built a function that collected all of the even numbers in an array
Built a function that updates an attribute in an object

Resources:

look for methods on the left (for both):
filter, map, forEach
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array#
keys
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object#

For Homework you will:
		write a function that collects all the numbers in an array that are under 10
test the function by running the file (using node) and console.logging the result
		write a function that given a car object (as an argument), changes it's make attribute to whatever is passed in (as an argument)
test the function by running the file (using node) and console.logging the result


Part 2: Github

Creating a project:
https://docs.github.com/en/github/importing-your-projects-to-github/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line

Branching off of a project:
https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/
git checkout -b feature/my-feature-name
git status
if the files you want are red ==> git add .
git status
if the files you want are green ==> git commit -m "Start setting up the feature"
git push origin feature/my-feature-name

Open a pull request to the main branch
https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request
Go to the github.com link for your project
Navigate to your branch
Open a pull request to the main branch
Make the pull request, adding any relevant comments

For homework you will:
NOTE: USE GITIGNORE TO NOT UPLOAD NODE_MODULES TO GITHUB
https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Node.gitignore (namely line 42)
(create a .gitignore file and put this line in it will automatically not add it to the checked in files)

		Upload your uber project to github and share the link on this channel

		Create a new branch, add some test code, and push the branch, share the link on this channel

		Open a pull request from your new branch to the main branch, share the link on this channel (to the pull request)
